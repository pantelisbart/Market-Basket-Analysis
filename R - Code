# Groceries dataset contains many receipts with products of each customer's purchases
# Each line is a receipt from a customer's basket


github <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jzuniga123"
file <- "/SPS/master/DATA%20624/GroceryDataSet.csv"
Groceries <- read.transactions(paste0(github, file), format="basket", sep=",")

 
# Αssociation rule is a relationship where {i1,i2} ⇒ i3 (if you put i1 & i2 in the basket you might put i3 as well)

# Support measures the frequency of the relationship in the dataset. 
# Ιt tells us what percentage of transactions contain the combination of items A and B. 
# e.g.purchasing fish and lemons together


# Confidence measures the probability that the association rule will be correct, 
# e.g., A = > B how many transactions that have bread (A) also have butter (B).

# Lift measures the effectiveness of the rule in finding consequents.

# Some general benchmarks:

# Lift < 1 does not indicate a cross selling opportunity

# Lift (A => B) = 1 means that within a set of elements there is no correlation.
# Lift (A = > B) > 1 means a positive correlation is more commonly purchased between the products in the product set, i.e. in items A and B.
# Lift(A =>B) < 1 means that it is unlikely to be purchased together for the negative correlation of the itemset, i.e. the products in the item set, A, and B.

# Drawback of confidence
# Confidence does not measure if the association between A and B is random or not. Whereas, Lift measures the strength of association between two items.

itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, topN=20, type="relative",col=rainbow(20),main="Frequency plot")


# Apriori assoc. rule . supp and conf are standard values usual 0.001 and 0.5. otherwise it called trust 
# The maxlen is the number of items in the basket. R will run forever if we don't specify it.
# max 2 items in the left and 1 in the right
rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8, maxlen=3))

# Redundancies
# Rules will be repeated sometimes. Redundancy means one item could be specified. 
# R will run forever and discover numerous rules. Many of them are pointless.
# So in order to reduce it to most importants we conclude in 29 rules with redundant. 



# Sort rules by maximum confidence (prob) and remove redundancies
rules <- sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=T)
rules <- rules[!is.redundant(rules)]
inspect(head(rules, 10))

# Rules interpretation:
# 90% of the buyers who bought liquor and red wine is likely to buy bottle beer too.
# support of 0.001931*100 = 0.19% indicates that 0.19% of the transaction in the data involve Product liquor, red wine purchases. 
# Hence the support indicates goodness of the choice of rule and confidence indicates the correctness of the rule.

# summary and model evaluation
summary(rules)

# The number of rules generated: 29
# The distribution of rules by length: Most rules are 3 items long


# Targeting Items
# What are customers who can buy whole milk before buying?
# 1) If customers buy whole milk, what are they likely to buy?
# 2) In essence, we want the left side and the right side of the hand. It’s not hard to do with R!


# We modify R to select as a standard value the whole milk and discover what other product are likely to buy
